# Deployment
This chapter should provide the user with all needed information around the deployment of your project.

Currently, the B01LER project is getting deployed to [render.com](https://render.com) periodically. In the near future, we intend on implementing a more formal deployment schedule so that the latest version of the project will be available to view and interact with.

The project can be viewed [here](https://b01ler.onrender.com/). This link allows you to experiment with the project and learn about how you can use components via Storybook.

We also deploy our JS Example app to [Render](https://b01ler.onrender.com/js-example-app). This application shows you how our components look when implemented in a vanilla Javascript application.
